Wish list for future enhancements:

* setuid() to unprivileged user after opening relevant streams.

* use ithreads for better real-time behaviour:
	
	- process
	- learner
	- sweeper
	- prober

	Process:    Always active, listens to packets on the wire.
                Handles ALIVE->PENDING and DEAD->ALIVE, manages
                the ARP table.

	Learner:    stays active for "n" iterations, then finishes.

	Prober:     waits for Learner to finish, then every second, probes
                the IPs that are PENDING, moving them to DEAD if necessary.

	Sweeper:    waits for Learner to finish, then periodically probes
                "quiet" IPs.
