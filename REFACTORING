    Busy on "M6::ARPSponge::Log".

---

* Use Moo for object building.
* Re-work event loop.

Current:
 - Rename M6::ARP:* to M6::ARPSponge::*

TODO:
    control socket "server" will need to overload print
    to catch "LOG|xxx" messages.

Need to work further on ARPSponge.pm:

 - Create "StateTable" and "ARPTable" classes.

Tests TODO:
 - M6::ARPSpong::Log

Client/Server communication:

Client Handle = Socket + Unsent Data.

Socket is set to non-blocking.

Writing on the client handle
----------------------------
A write to the client will be added to the unsent data, and an attempt to
write to the socket is made.

Attempting socket writes
------------------------
Data is written to the socket, but if the no. of bytes written is less than the
buffer size, the socket FD is removed from the select read mask, and added to
the select write mask. Conversely, if all data is transferred, the socket FD
is removed from the select write mask, and added to the select read mask.


Event loop
----------

In the event loop, we look for client handles. Writeable handles will result
in another round of attempted socket writes, readable handles will result in
the fetching of a command.
